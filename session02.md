# FPGA Design Flow and Simulation Steps

## General Design Flow Steps

### 1. **Design Entry**
- Create the design at the **Register Transfer Level (RTL)** using a hardware description language (HDL) or schematics.

### 2. **Synthesis**
- Checks code syntax.
- Converts the abstract description of circuit behavior into a design implementation at the **gate level (Netlist)**.
- **Netlist**: A text-based representation of the logic diagram consisting of gates, flip-flops, etc.

### 3. **Translate**
- Combines the netlist with **constraints** (e.g., physical port assignments, timing requirements).
- Produces a device-specific design file.

### 4. **Map**
- Maps the design to specific FPGA resources such as LUTs, Flip-Flops, RAM blocks, etc.

### 5. **Place and Route**
- Decides the physical placement of resources on the FPGA.
- Wires them together while considering timing constraints.

### 6. **Generate Configuration Bit File**
- Produces a bit file that can be downloaded onto the FPGA to implement the design.

## General Simulation Steps

### 1. **Behavioral Simulation**
- Verifies the **RTL code** functionality.
- Does not consider timing or resource usage.

### 2. **Gate-Level Functional Simulation**
- Simulates the gate-level description generated during synthesis.
- Identifies potential coding issues that work at the RTL level but violate synthesis rules.

### 3. **Gate-Level Timing Simulation**
- Includes propagation delays in the simulation.
- Ensures the design meets timing requirements.

## Static Timing Analysis (STA)

- **Gate-level timing simulation** of the entire design can be very slow and is not recommended for modern FPGAs (e.g., Cyclone, Arria, Stratix V devices).

- Instead, use **Static Timing Analysis (STA):**
  - A method to calculate expected timing without running a full simulation.
  - Considers timing paths such as:
    - Register-to-register.
    - Input port-to-register.
    - Register-to-output port.
    - Purely combinational paths.
  - Does not require test vectors.

- **Limitation:** STA does not verify design functionality.
  - **Recommendation:** Combine STA with behavioral simulation to ensure both timing and functionality are verified.
